# tongue-twister
Grad school project.  Given a single word, can you build a tongue twister based on a SAMPA database? 

This was fun - basically I had to look at the features of English to figure out what was a close word vowels and consonants.

This was written on VS for Mac on Mono- download and load the *.sln then run.
